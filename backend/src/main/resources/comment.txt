1) Client Request (Postman)

The client (you) sends a POST request to the /employees/registerEmployee endpoint using Postman.
The request body contains the employee details in JSON format.

2) Controller Layer

   The request is handled by the EmployeeController class.
   The registerUser method in the EmployeeController class is mapped to the /registerEmployee URL using the @PostMapping annotation.
   The method accepts the request body as a parameter, which is automatically converted from JSON to an Employee DTO (Data Transfer Object) by Spring.

3) Service Layer

   The EmployeeController calls the registerTheEmployee method in the EmployeeService class.
   The service method converts the Employee DTO to an EmployeeEntity object.
   The EmployeeService uses the EmployeeRepository to save the EmployeeEntity object to the database.

4) Repository Layer

   The EmployeeRepository, which extends JpaRepository, handles the database operations.
   The save method of JpaRepository is called to insert the new employee record into the database.

5) Database Update

   The database is updated with the new employee record.
   The primary key (ID) of the new employee is returned from the repository to the service layer, and then to the controller, which sends it back to the client as the response.

-- Detailed Explanation with Annotations
Client Request (Postman)

In Postman:

Set the request type to POST.
Set the URL to http://localhost:8080/employees/registerEmployee.
Set the request body to raw JSON and include the employee data:

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Controller Layer (EmployeeController)

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/employees")
@AllArgsConstructor
public class EmployeeController {
    private EmployeeService service;

    @PostMapping("/registerEmployee")
    public long registerUser(@RequestBody Employee employee) {
        return service.registerTheEmployee(employee);
    }
}


The @RestController annotation makes this class a RESTful web service controller.
The @RequestMapping("/employees") sets the base URL for all endpoints in this controller.
The @PostMapping("/registerEmployee") maps POST requests to the registerUser method.
The @RequestBody annotation binds the incoming JSON payload to the Employee DTO.
-------------------------------------------
Service Layer (EmployeeService)

@Service
public class EmployeeService {
    private final EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    public EmployeeService(EmployeeRepository employeeRepository) {
        this.employeeRepository = employeeRepository;
    }

    public long registerTheEmployee(Employee employee) {
        EmployeeEntity employeeEntity = EmployeeEntity.builder()
            .firstName(employee.getFirstName())
            .lastName(employee.getLastName())
            .email(employee.getEmail())
            .build();

        EmployeeEntity savedEmployee = employeeRepository.save(employeeEntity);
        return savedEmployee.getId();
    }
}
The @Service annotation marks this class as a service component in the Spring context.
The registerTheEmployee method converts the Employee DTO to an EmployeeEntity and saves it to the database using the EmployeeRepository.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repository Layer (EmployeeRepository)

@Repository
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<EmployeeEntity, Long> {
}
The @Repository annotation marks this interface as a repository component.
The EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository, which provides methods to perform CRUD operations on the EmployeeEntity.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entity Class (EmployeeEntity)

@Entity
@Table(name = "employees")
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
public class EmployeeEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "first_name")
    private String firstName;

    @Column(name = "last_name")
    private String lastName;

    @Column(name = "email_id", nullable = false, unique = true)
    private String email;
}
The @Entity annotation marks this class as a JPA entity.
The @Table(name = "employees") annotation specifies the table name in the database.
The @Id and @GeneratedValue annotations define the primary key and its generation strategy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DTO Class (Employee)

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Employee {
    private Long id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private String email;
}
The Employee class is a DTO used to transfer data between the controller and service layers.
Summary
Client (Postman): Sends a POST request with employee details in JSON format to the /employees/registerEmployee endpoint.
Controller (EmployeeController): Receives the request and calls the service layer, passing the Employee DTO.
Service (EmployeeService): Converts the Employee DTO to an EmployeeEntity and saves it using the repository.
Repository (EmployeeRepository): Handles database operations and saves the new employee record.
Database: The new employee record is inserted into the database, and the generated ID is returned as the response.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create New Resources: The main use of a POST request is to submit data to the server to create a new resource.

The way to say this :

The client sends a POST requests to the '/employees/registerEmployee' endpoint with a JSON body containing the employee details.
Controller (EmployeeController): The controller method registerEmployee handles the POST request.
Service Layer: The controller calls the service method registerTheEmployee to process the employee data.
Database Update: The service method saves the new employee to the database and returns the generated ID.
Response: The controller returns a ResponseEntity containing the new employee's ID and an HTTP status of 201 Created.
